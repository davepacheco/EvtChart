Event Charts visualize event logs

Event logs are a simple format for describing generic events, including start
and end times, event names, and parent-child relationships.  The canonical
example is for process execution, tracing the creation of new processes, their
child processes, and their duration.

An event log has the following format:

TIME(ns) EVENT ID ID_NAME PARENT_ID EXTRAS

For example, the following shows a process log (generated using the included
procevt.d DTrace script):

TIME(ns) EVENT ID ID_NAME PARENT_ID EXTRAS
93830738811087 start 66526 bash 93708
93830740205965 change 66526 sleeptest.sh 93708
93830741823055 change 66526 sleeptest.sh->ksh93 93708
93830746023333 start 66527 ksh93 66526
93830746221818 change 66527 sleep 66526
93831749169097 end 66527 sleep 66526
[...]

This full example is in the included procevt_sample.txt log. This traces the
execution of the example sleeptest.sh script, also included.

The log file was generated using:

# ./procevt.d > procevt_sample.txt

And the event chart SVG (renamed to procevt_sample.svg) was generated using:

$ ./evtchart.pl procevt_sample.txt

There are various tunables at the top of the evtchart.pl program to customize
the output.

A PNG version of procevt_sample.svg has been included (converted using an
external tool).

Event charts can be used for other tasks, including function execution,
provided that an evt log can be collected.
